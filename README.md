# Tinotenda Chingwena Personal Website

Hello there :)! The code in the main branch of this repository is the server and client currently available at [tinotendachingwena.com].

This website uses Spring Boot 2.7.15 for the backend and is currently deployed on Heroku. For the client I used HTML5, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and CSS. I made this repo open source so that stakeholders can have a preview into some of my programming skills and concepts. Further, it is also a learning oppurtunity for me as this opens room for various people to applaud, guide, and critique.
